# SentimentAnalysis

A sentiment analysis is being trained to categorize the number of reviews as negative or positive using Naive Bayes. Naive Bayes is a simple model that has a simplified view of how tests and classes are related. However, since the aim is to only classify whether something is A or B, it is sufficient for the task.

Libraries used are sklearn, pandas and matplotlib.

Data used is based on Google Play reviews, created by Prakhar Rathi.
